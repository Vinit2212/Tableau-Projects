# Waste Collection Insights from 5 Boroughs

This project provides an analysis of waste collection data from the five boroughs of New York City: Brooklyn, Queens, Manhattan, Bronx, and Staten Island. The dashboard visualizes key insights regarding the collection and distribution of different types of waste, including Refuse, Paper, and Metal/Glass/Plastic (MGP) Tons.

## Key Insights

### 1. Community Districts by Borough
- **Brooklyn** has the highest number of community districts compared to other boroughs.
- **Staten Island**, despite having the fewest community districts, showcases interesting trends in refuse collection.

### 2. Waste Collection Distribution
- **Queens** collects the highest percentage of MGP Tons among all boroughs.
- **Brooklyn** leads in the collection of Refuse and Paper Tons, significantly more than other boroughs.

### 3. Recycling and Refuse Patterns
- While **Queens** has the highest total tons of waste collected, recycling efficiency in terms of "Refuse by Recycle" is notable in some community districts of **Manhattan** and **Brooklyn**.
- This indicates disparities in recycling efforts across different boroughs.

### 4. Refuse Collection Per Capita
- **Staten Island**, despite its smaller population and fewer community districts, has the highest amount of refuse collected per person. This highlights the borough's unique waste generation patterns.

## Visualizations

The dashboard includes the following visual components:

- **Bar Charts**: Compare tons of Refuse, Paper, and MGP collected across boroughs.
- **Pie Chart**: Visualize the percentage breakdown of total waste collected by borough.
- **Stacked Chart**: Illustrate the composition of different waste types collected.
- **Line Graph**: Show trends in Paper and MGP Tons collected by borough.
- **Circle Chart**: Highlight borough-wise total recycling performance.
- **Word Cloud**: Emphasize key borough names based on waste collection statistics.
- **Highlight Table**: Provide detailed metrics for MGP %, Paper %, and Refuse Tons collected.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the disparities and unique patterns in waste collection across the five boroughs of NYC. The analysis provides actionable insights for policymakers and waste management authorities to optimize recycling efforts and waste collection strategies.

## Future Scope

- Explore factors influencing per capita refuse collection in Staten Island.
- Investigate community-level recycling programs to improve performance in boroughs like Brooklyn and Manhattan.
- Incorporate demographic and socioeconomic data for deeper analysis of waste generation trends.
